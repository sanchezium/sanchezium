MASTERNODE GUIDE FOR WINDOWS AND LINUX

1.Open and Run the Sanchezium-qt.exe wallet for the first time, if you are using Windows.
2.Your firewall and antivirus might pop up to allow connection. Please allow the connections by making appropriate tick marks.
3.Immediately stop and exit your wallet.
4.Download the bootstrap file and add it to C:/users/***Your windows username***/appdata(hidden)/roaming/Sanchezium "http://sanchezium.com/downloads/bootstrap.dat"
5 Restart your wallet
6.In the lower left hand corner of the User Interface, you will see “Importing blocks” and other sync messages each time you open your Sanchezium Wallet. If there is a problem synchronizing, it may say “No Block Source Available” instead. If this happens, just close and re-open the wallet until it synchronizes. 
7.Go to Help -> Debug Console.
8.In the Console window enter getaccountaddress 0 and copy the result. This is your MASTERNODE DEPOSIT ADDRESS, where you will deposit the coins to create a masternode. Pay 10000 Sanchezium exactly into this address. No more, no less.
-·Wait for the 1 confirmation of the transaction.
9.In the Console Debug window enter masternode genkey and copy the result. This is your MASTERNODE PRIVKEY.
10.Open Configuration File in Notepad, if you are using Windows. This config file is located at C:/users/***Your windows username***/appdata(hidden)/roaming/Sanchezium  Then paste in the following.

rpcuser=ANYTHINGHERE
rpcpassword=ANYTHINGHERE
daemon=1
server=1
staking=1
listen=1
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
rpcport=11464
masternode=1
masternodeaddr=YourIP:11463
masternodeprivkey=PRIVATEKEYREPLACETHIS


11.Now save and close the config file.
12.Close the wallet by going to File -> Exit.
Open the Sanchezium Wallet again by running Sanchezium-qt.exe. This is how you will always start the wallet going forward.
13. Wait for 15 confirmations of the transaction of 10000 coins.
Go to Tools -> Debug Console. Enter masternode start. You will see the response “Masternode started successfully”. Congratulations, your masternode is now running.
Now click the Masternodes tab that is now visible. You should see your new masternode appear in the list with the status PRE_ENABLE.
This will change to ENABLED after a small amount of time. All masternodes need to be active for a certain amount of blocks before they are recognized by the network and eligible for rewards.

This guide assumes you already have a vps ordered and putty connected to it as root
First some basics.

Create a Swap File - Low Ram Servers
 sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile
 sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
 sudo mkswap /swapfile
 sudo swapon /swapfile
 sudo nano /etc/fstab

Add to fstab file by using arrow down and pasting the following on the file after all that already is there
/swapfile   none    swap    sw    0   0

once done press CTRL x
press y
press enter  # done

These are the dependencies listed on most coin repositories

Dependency Build Instructions: Ubuntu & Debian
----------------------------------------------
sudo apt-get install build-essential -y
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev -y
sudo apt-get install libdb++-dev -y
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev -y
sudo apt-get install libqrencode-dev -y

I have included some extras that help bypass some of the issues and are not mentioned as dependencies on the documentation of most coins.

sudo apt-get install libtool autotools-dev automake pkg-config libevent-dev bsdmainutils libgmp3-dev -y

On at least Ubuntu 14.04+ and Debian 7+ there are generic names for the individual boost development packages, so the following can be used to only install necessary parts of boost:

sudo apt-get install libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-chrono-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-test-dev libboost-thread-dev -y


This is a must to avoid errors

sudo apt-get install software-properties-common -y
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev -y

sudo apt-get install libminiupnpc-dev -y
sudo apt-get install libzmq3-dev -y

cd /home

git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1.git

cd secp256k1/
./autogen.sh
./configure
  make
./tests
sudo make install  # optional

cd ..

git clone https://github.com/sanchezium/sanchezium.git
cd sanchezium/src
make -f makefile.unix

grab yourself a drink while the wallet compiles
 
all should be installed and you can start your daemon
 
 ./Sancheziumd -daemon
 ./Sancheziumd stop
 
 cd /root/.Sanchezium
 wget http://sanchezium.com/downloads/bootstrap.dat
 
 cd /home/sanchezium/src
 ./Sancheziumd -daemon
 
once you synced your wallet go to:
 
 cd /root/.Sanchezium
 nano Sanchezium.conf

this will open config file all you need to do is paste the following and amend accordingly

rpcuser=ANYTHINGHERE
rpcpassword=ANYTHINGHERE
daemon=1
server=1
staking=1
listen=1
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
rpcport=11464
masternode=1
masternodeaddr=YourIP:11463
masternodeprivkey=PRIVATEKEYREPLACETHIS

please make sure that the info for the masternode section matches your local wallet on your computer.

once this is done press 
CTRL x

then press y and press ENTER

Go back to your wallet/src directory stop the daemon and restart it again.

now vps side is done we need to go to the local wallet to start the masternode.

if you only have 1 masternode in your wallet go to console and type

masternode start

if you have more than one you can run a simlar command

masternode start-many

happy masternoding
