MASTERNODE GUIDE FOR WINDOWS AND LINUX

1a.Open and Run the Sanchezium-qt.exe wallet for the first time, if you are using Windows.
1b.Open and Run the Sanchezium-qt wallet for the first time, if you are using Linux.
2.Your firewall and antivirus might pop up to allow connection. Please allow the connections by making appropriate tick marks.
3.In the lower left hand corner of the User Interface, you will see “Synchronizing with network” and other sync messages each time you open your Sanchezium Wallet. If there is a problem synchronizing, it may say “No Block Source Available” instead. If this happens, just close and re-open the wallet until it synchronizes. 
4.Go to Help -> Debug Console.
5.In the Console window enter getaccountaddress 0 and copy the result. This is your MASTERNODE DEPOSIT ADDRESS, where you will deposit the coins to create a masternode. Pay 10000 Sanchezium exactly into this address. No more, no less.
-·Wait for the 1 confirmation of the transaction.
6.In the Console Debug window enter masternode genkey and copy the result. This is your MASTERNODE PRIVKEY.
7a.Open Configuration File in Notepad, if you are using Windows. This config file is located at C:/users/***Your windows username***/appdata(hidden)/roaming/Sanchezium  Then paste in the following.
7b.Open Configuration File in Gedit, if you are using Linux. This config file is located at /home/***Your Linux username***/.Sanchezium(hidden)/  Then paste in the following.

rpcuser=ANYTHINGHERE
rpcpassword=ANYTHINGHERE
daemon=1
server=1
staking=1
listen=1
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
rpcport=11464
masternode=1
masternodeaddr=YourIP:11463
masternodeprivkey=PRIVATEKEYREPLACETHIS


8.Now save and close the config file.
9.Close the wallet by going to File -> Exit.
Open the Sanchezium Wallet again by running Sanchezium-qt.exe. This is how you will always start the wallet going forward.
10. Wait for 15 confirmations of the transaction of 10000 coins.
Go to Tools -> Debug Console. Enter masternode start. You will see the response “Masternode started successfully”. Congratulations, your masternode is now running.
Now click the Masternodes tab that is now visible. You should see your new masternode appear in the list with the status PRE_ENABLE.
This will change to ENABLED after a small amount of time. All masternodes need to be active for a certain amount of blocks before they are recognized by the network and eligible for rewards.

Multiple Masternodes setup Guide
------------------------------------
Step-by-step guide for starting multiple masternodes (3 masternodes in this example)
Requirements
 - Sanchezium wallet running on your local computer with at least 10000 Sanchezium coins for every masternode 
 - white static IP with open ports for masternodes

1.Open and Run the Sanchezium-qt.exe wallet for the first time.  
2.Your firewall and antivirus might pop up to allow connection. Please allow the connections by making appropriate tick marks.
3.In the lower left hand corner of the User Interface, you will see “Synchronizing with network” and other sync messages each time you open your Sanchezium Wallet. If there is a problem synchronizing, it may say “No Block Source Available” instead. If this happens, just close and re-open the wallet until it synchronizes. 

STEP 1 : Preparing masternodes
1 - Choose the place where you will hold your masternodes dirs (you need 1Gb free space for every masternode)
2 - Create folder "SancheziumMN1" there (example in C: drive)
3 - Copy file "Sanchezium-qt.exe" in folder "SancheziumMN1"
4 - Create in folder "SancheziumMN1" new folder "data"
Sanchezium folder is located at C:/users/***Your windows username***/appdata(hidden)/roaming/Sanchezium
5 - Copy file "blk0001.dat" and folder "txleveldb" from the above folder into the created folder "data" 
6 - Rename "Sanchezium-qt.exe" to the "Sanchezium-mn1.exe" 
7 - Press Win+R and type "cmd" and press Enter
8 - Now type there:
echo start Sanchezium-mn1.exe -datadir=./data > %homepath%/Desktop/startmn1.cmd
9 - Move file "startmn1.cmd" from Desktop to the "SancheziumMN1" folder
10 - Repeat the process from step 2 for each masternode you want to created, with changing mn1 to mn2, mn3
11 - Run startmn1.cmd, startmn2.cmd and startmn3.cmd, wait for complete loading wallets and complete syncing with blockchain
12 - Now you can exit from each running masternode wallets

Now you can follow the same steps of single masternode guide
4.Go to Help -> Debug Console.
5.In the Console window enter getaccountaddress 0 and copy the result. This is your MASTERNODE DEPOSIT ADDRESS, where you will deposit the coins to create a masternode. Pay 10000 Sanchezium exactly into this address. No more, no less.
-·Wait for the 1 confirmation of the transaction.
6.In the Console Debug window enter masternode genkey and copy the result. This is your MASTERNODE PRIVKEY.
7.Open Configuration File in Notepad. This config file is located at C:/users/***Your windows username***/appdata(hidden)/roaming/Sanchezium  Then paste in the following.

rpcuser=ANYTHINGHERE
rpcpassword=ANYTHINGHERE
daemon=1
server=1
staking=1
listen=1
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
rpcport=11464
masternode=1
masternodeaddr=YourIP:11463
masternodeprivkey=PRIVATEKEYREPLACETHIS

8.Now save and close the config file.
9.Close the wallet by going to File -> Exit.
Open the Sanchezium Wallet again by running Sanchezium-qt.exe. This is how you will always start the wallet going forward.
10. Wait for 15 confirmations of the transaction of 10000 coins.
Go to Tools -> Debug Console. Enter "masternode start" in all the wallet's consoles. You will see the response “Masternode started successfully”. Congratulations, your masternode is now running.
All masternodes need to be active for a certain amount of blocks before they are recognized by the network and eligible for rewards.
